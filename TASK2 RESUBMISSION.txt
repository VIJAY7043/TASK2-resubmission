The Window Object:

1. Global Scope:

The window object represents the global context in a browser environment.
All global variables and functions are properties of the window object.
It serves as the top-level object, encompassing everything within a browser window or tab.

2. Browser Interactions:

Handles browser-related functionalities like opening, closing, or resizing windows.
Manages browser history and navigation through methods like history.back() and history.forward().
Provides access to the browser's location and can be used to redirect to new URLs.

3. Timers and Events:

Manages timers and intervals using functions like setTimeout and setInterval.
Handles global events like resizing the window or closing the browser.

4. Global Functions:

Houses globally accessible functions like alert(), confirm(), and prompt().
Provides methods for interacting with the browser environment, such as open() for opening new windows.

The Document Object:

1. Document Content:

The document object represents the HTML document loaded in the browser window.
It provides an interface to manipulate the structure, content, and styles of the document.

2. DOM Manipulation:

Allows access to elements within the document through methods like getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector.
Facilitates manipulation of the DOM (Document Object Model) to dynamically update content without requiring a page reload.

3. Styling and Layout:

Controls styles and layout properties, enabling developers to dynamically modify the appearance of elements on the page.
Offers methods for working with CSS classes, stylesheets, and inline styles.

4. Events and Event Handling:

Manages events triggered by user interactions or other actions.
Enables developers to attach event listeners to elements and respond to user input or system events.

Differences and Relationships:
Scope:

Window: Represents the global context of the browser.
Document: Represents the HTML document within the window.
Functionality:

Window: Focuses on browser-related functionalities and global interactions.
Document: Primarily deals with the content, structure, and styling of the HTML document.
Hierarchy:

Window: Encompasses the entire browser window or tab.
Document: Is a part of the window object and represents the loaded HTML document.

Understanding the distinctions between the document and window objects is crucial for effective web development. While the window object manages global browser interactions, the document object empowers developers to manipulate the content and structure of the loaded HTML document. Together, these objects form the backbone of client-side scripting, enabling dynamic and interactive web applications.
